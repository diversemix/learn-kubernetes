Before going any further, let's make sure everything is installed and configured
correctly. You'll need the following, so if you don't have them, ctrl-c and
install them (see README.md)

 - docker (as minikube will use this as a driver,
        see https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)

 - minikube (see https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

 - kubectl (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
