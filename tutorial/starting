Before going any further, let's make sure everything is installed and configured
correctly. You'll need the following, so if you don't have them, ctrl-c and
install them (see README.md)

 - docker (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
   NOTE:  minikube will use this as a driver, see:
          https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)

 - minikube (see https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

 - kubectl (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

Let's check that you have these installed. If any of these checks fail you
won't be able to continue without installing / rectifying the issues, let's
check...
